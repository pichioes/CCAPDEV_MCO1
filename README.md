Hello po sir!

To gain access to the database, we would have to add you to the MongoDB project. Please contact Mansueto (in Canvas or Gmail: maria_alyssa_mansueto@dlsu.edu.ph) for access. 

After gaining access to the DB, please run cmd from the directory of the MCO folder then input "npm run devStart".
After this, you may enter "localhost:3000" in your browser to access the website.
