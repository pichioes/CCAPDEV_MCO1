Hello po sir!

For running the code, it would need to be run from a VSCode plugin named "Live Server". This is because the partials (navigation bar and footer) and modals do not load without it.

To run Live Server, please open the project folder in VSCode and right-click any HTML file. From the options shown, please select "Open with Live Server". From there, you will be able to navigate the website as intended by the group.

We are sorry for the inconvenience. We will try to fix this issue moving forward.
