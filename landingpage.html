                <p>Lay Bare began as a family-owned salon in 2006 when three siblings founders Paolo, Fiona and Monique couldn't find a salon dedicated to the art of waxing. So, they set out to craft the perfect experience and introduced a new world of waxing possibilities for those who dared to bare it all.</p>
